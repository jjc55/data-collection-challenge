# data-collection-challenge
Module 11 Challenge

In this challenge, I practiced my web-scrapping skills using information from two websites: Mars news articles and Mars weather data. In part 1 of this assignment, I parsed HTML data to collect the title and preview text from the website featuring articles related to Mars. In part 2 of this assignment, I parsed HTML data to collect information about the weather on Mars and later created a data frame. Using this data frame, I analyzed and developed various graphs about Mars' weather using matplotlib and pandas.
